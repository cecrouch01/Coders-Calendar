# <Coder's-Calendar>

## Description

This is a website that is designed to be used to help maximize the potential out of the work day by giving the user the ability to schedule what they are going to be doing during a given hour in the work day. This is a great way to help improve productibility and a great way to be self-sufficient in doing the tasks that need to be done on a daily basis. This project was built as a freelancers helper because it will the give the user a way to eliminate distractions. 



## Installation

Go to this URL: https://cecrouch01.github.io/Coders-Calendar/

## Usage

Go to https://cecrouch01.github.io/Coders-Calendar/ once the user will be able to see a textbox for each hour of the business day. If the box is colored grey (past), red (present), and green (future). The user can then type what needs to be done during that time period and will be able to save it by hitting the save button.

## Credits

I used bootstrap and JQuery as Third Party API's. 
I used this website to help me figure out how to dynamically change the past/present/future textbox color written by user "Xupitan" https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72512032/how-can-i-compare-the-current-time-with-my-divs-id-900-in-javascript
